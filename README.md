## Description

This is a two player snake game based on my last project 'react-snake-game'.

This app is being hosted at https://two-player-snake.herokuapp.com/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Rules

Black snake controls:
 - Arrow keys
 
 Blue snake controls:
 - WASD
 
 Each player is trying to eat as many apples as they can. The goal is to reach 50 points before the other person.
 If you touch a wall, the other snake, or your own snake, you lose one point, and your snake gets one square shorter. 
 Your snake will also turn red to indicate the fact that you are injured, and you mus wait for your tail to connect with your head before you can move again.
